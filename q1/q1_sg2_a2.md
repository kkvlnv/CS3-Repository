**Instructions:**
The problem: Finding the highest (Maximum) number from a given list of numbers.

<h3 = align = "left">PseudoCode 1</h3>

~~~
Algorithm FindMax1(numbers)

   max ← numbers[0]

   For i from 1 to length(numbers)-1

      If numbers[i] > max Then

         max ← numbers[i]

      EndIf

   EndFor

   Return max

EndAlgorithm

<h3 = align = "right">PseudoCode 2</h3>

~~~
Algorithm FindMax2(numbers)

  For i from 0 to length (numbers)-1bigger ← true

    For j from 0 to length(numbers)-1

      If numbers[j] > numbers[i] Then

        bigger ← false

      EndIf

    EndFor

    If bigger = true Then

      Return numbers[i]

    EndIf

  EndFor

EndAlgorithm

**Questions with Checklist**

<b>1. Efficiency </b>  \
Which algorithm is faster when the list of numbers is very large? Why?

Algorithm 1 is faster especially when the list of numbers is very large because its structure does not have a 
nested loop (unlike Algorithm 2). It also would finish earlier than Algorithm 2 because it does not have to loop
through every element to find the max.

  <td align = "left">- [ ] Which algorithm finishes in fewer steps?</td>
</tr>
</table>

<b>2. Readability </b>  \
Which algorithm is easier to understand at first glance? What makes it clearer?

Algorithm 1 is easier to understand at first glance because it has only one loop (which makes it easier to follow)
and the variable names are also clear.

<b>3. Maintainability </b>  \
If you had to add a new feature (like finding both max and min), which algorithm would be easier to update? Why?

If I had to add a feature that finds both max and min, algorithm 1 would be easier simply because it has a solid base with its simple code.

    <td align = "left">- [no] Is there less chance of errors when updating?</td>
  </tr>

<b>4. Testability </b>  \
Which algorithm is easier to test with different inputs? Why?

Algorithm 1 because it doesn't have to go through each element every time it loops so it finishes relatively earlier.

    <td align = "left"><b>PseudoCode 1</b></td>

  <tr>
    <td align = "left">- [yes] Is the output predictable and clear?</td>
    <td align = "left">- [no] Is the output predictable and clear?</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<b>5. Security </b>  \
Imagine the input list comes from a user. What should the algorithm check to avoid errors or misuse?

The algorithm should work through empty lists and invalid inputs
such as special characters, strings, and booleans.

<b>6. Final Answer </b>  \
Based on your answers from 1 to 5, which one is the better algorithm that you will use to solve the problem of finding the highest number? Why? Summarize your answer.

Based on my answers, algorithm 1 would be the better pick because it is more efficient and straight-forward. 
Although it also has limitations with its code, it is easier to fix than algorithm 2.
